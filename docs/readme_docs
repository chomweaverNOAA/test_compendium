ReadMe for Docs Folder

The purpose of this folder is hold rendered versions of the reports (if applicable). Note that this is different from the manuscript folder, which would have version(s) of the manuscript not rendered directly from the repository.

Note: to create a template with standardized folder structure, there needs to be a document within the folder to save to github. This readme serves as this document, and can be deleted from your personal project/repository.
