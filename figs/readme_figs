ReadMe for Figs Folder

The purpose of this folder is hold all figures generated for the analysis. Your code to create figures should be saved in the code folder, and it should automatically save figure output directly to this figs folder. All figure names should be descriptive not based on the # of the figure (as this may change).

Note: to create a template with standardized folder structure, there needs to be a document within the folder to save to github. This readme serves as this document, and can be deleted from your personal project/repository.
