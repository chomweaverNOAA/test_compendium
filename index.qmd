## What is a Research Compendium?

A Research Compendium serves as both a 'home' for all the digital components of a research project as well as a means of managing, updating, and sharing this information. We want to create this collection so that reproducing the results is straightforward. 

Because PAM data is naturally very large data-- we do NOT want to save our raw acoustic data here. We do recommend that your research compendium provide information on accessing this raw data. This is valuable for others, and for Future You. 

This research compendium is set up to create an HTML output (not necessarily a word doc or pdf). 


## How To Use This Template

This template will create a Github Repository with the standard folders, a descriptive ReadMe that only requires slight modification, and the foundation for a Quarto website that can serve as a summary of your project. Follow the steps below to copy this template to your lab's GitHub

1.  Open [this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/PAM_template_ResearchCompendium)

2.  Click on the 'Use this template' button in the top right, select 'Create new repository'
