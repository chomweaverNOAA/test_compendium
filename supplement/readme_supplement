ReadMe for Supplement Folder

The purpose of this folder is to hold any supplementary files that are not data, script, or components of the manuscript.

Note: to create a template with standardized folder structure, there needs to be a document within the folder to save to github. This readme serves as this document, and can be deleted from your personal project/repository.
