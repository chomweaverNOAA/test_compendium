ReadMe for Data Folder

The purpose of this folder is hold ORIGINAL raw or raw-derived data. Github is NOT an appropriate platform for saving large files or large numbers of files. You will need to save your raw data (and possible other large data products) in an alternative location, such as NCEI, Figshare, or Zenodo. We recommend that you identify the location of all raw data (WHERE?). As this data is intended to be ORIGINAL data, we recommend that modified or intermediate data or data products (that are modified by code stored in the code folder) be stored in the output folder.


Note: to create a template with standardized folder structure, there needs to be a document within the folder to save to github. This readme serves as this document, and can be deleted from your personal project/repository.
