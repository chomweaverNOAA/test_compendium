ReadMe for Manuscript Folder

The purpose of this folder is to provide a home to one or more versions of the manuscript in one or more formats. This folder does not serve as the output location for rendered versions of the manuscript (those would be saved in the docs folder). Typically, this would be reserved for final manuscripts or manuscripts saved in an alternative format or manually modified (not direct rendered output).


Note: to create a template with standardized folder structure, there needs to be a document within the folder to save to github. This readme serves as this document, and can be deleted from your personal project/repository.
