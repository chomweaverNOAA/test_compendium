We want to create this collection so that reproducing the results is straightforward.\nBecause PAM data is naturally very large data– we do NOT want to save our raw acoustic data here. We do recommend that your research compendium provide information on accessing this raw data. This is valuable for others, and for Future You.\nThis research compendium is set up to create an HTML output (not necessarily a word doc or pdf).",

Follow the steps below to copy this template to your lab’s GitHub\n\nOpen this repository on GitHub\nClick on the ‘Use this template’ button in the top right, select ‘Create new repository’\n\nEdit repository settings\n\nSelect the ‘Include all branches’ option\nSelect your lab organization or yourself as the owner and set the repository name to your Project Name\nMake description “Research Compendium for Project Name”\nMake the repo public\n\n\nClick create repository\nTurn on GitHub pages under Settings-&gt;Pages. You will set pages to be made from the gh-pages branch and root directory\n\nUpdate ‘Actions’ settings\n\nUnder Settings -&gt; Actions -&gt; General -&gt; Actions permissions select ‘Allow all actions and reusable workflows’. Select save\n\nUnder Settings -&gt; Actions -&gt; General -&gt; Workflow permissions select ‘Read and write permissions’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Both of these settings may already be selected but you have to click save for both\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to the main page of the repo to edit your website\n\nClick on ‘Code’ in the top left\nClick on the settings button next to the ‘About’ section on the right side of the repository\nSelect ‘Use your GitHub Pages website’. This should autopopulate the website\nSelect ‘Save Changes’\n\n\nThe foundation for your Research Compendium is now created! We recommend that you first modify the ReadMe to add your Project Name in the appropriate places.",
