This template provides a set of standard folders for specific types of
files. We recommend following these standard approaches as consistency
allows us to follow each other's research workflow.

Here we further explain how to work with this folder structure, with
tips and tricks to make your work more accessible, reproducible, and to
help Future You!

## 📁 manuscript 

Manuscript for Report. This may contain one or more versions of the
manuscript in one or more formats. This folder does **not** serve as the
output location for rendered versions of the manuscript (those would be
saved in the ***docs*** folder). Typically, this would be reserved for
final manuscripts or manuscripts saved in an alternative format or
manually modified (not direct rendered output).

## 📁 content 

This Research Compendium template is formatted for a HTML (website)
output, and all chapters/sections for online report should reside in
this content folder.

## 📁 figs 

Contains all figures generated for the analysis. Your code to create
figures should be saved in the ***code*** folder, and it should
automatically save figure output directly to this ***figs*** folder. All
figure names should be descriptive **not** based on the \# of the figure
(as this may change).

## 📁 docs 

Contains rendered versions of the reports (if applicable). Note that
this is different from the ***manuscript*** folder, which would have
version(s) of the manuscript **not** rendered directly from the
repository.

## 📁 data 

Contains ORIGINAL raw or raw-derived data. Github is *NOT* an
appropriate platform for saving large files or large numbers of files.
You will need to save your raw data (and possible other large data
products) in an alternative location, such as NCEI,
[Figshare](https://figshare.com/), or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). We
recommend that you identify the location of all raw data (WHERE?). As
this data is intended to be ORIGINAL data, we recommend that modified or
intermediate data or data products (that are modified by code stored in
the ***code*** folder) be stored in the ***output*** folder.

## Note: Where do we recommend that they identify the location of any data or data products not directly saved to this repository? In the readme? or the index file?
:::

## 📁 output

This can include any modified or intermediate data or data products
(data in data folder is ORIGINAL), and data in output may be modified
using code stored in ***code*** folder.

## 📁 code

Scripts that actually do things. If using R, your script should use the
[here package](https://here.r-lib.org/) rather than setwd() to build
paths to files and allow for more efficient reproduction of workflow.
Script should automatically access data in the data folder and save
output to relevant folders (output, figs).

### **\_commonR.R**

We recommend saving commonly used functions in the \_commonR.R file
(assuming you are using R for your analysis– if not, you can delete this
file). This is a good place to identify the libraries to load, any
themes or common formatting requirements, or other common functions.
Ideally these types of functions are only located in **one** place, so
that they only need to be changed in one place. You can then source this
file in other code (reduces redundancy and allows you to modify these
basic functions in one place instead of throughout your various
scripts).

## 📁 supplement

Supplementary files that are not data, script, or components of the
manuscript.
